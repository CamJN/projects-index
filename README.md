projects-index
==============
This page provides a pretty overview of the projects on my box.

###requirements:
* project domains all listed on one line in a file specified in config (default: `/etc/hosts`)
* project domains all have the same tld (default: `.dev`)
* projects have a png at `https?://([^/]+)/\1\.png`
* this page was forked on github, or no github contact provided, as the link to the project on github assumes a fork
